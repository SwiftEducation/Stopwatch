# How to Contribute

## Post an Issue

If you discover a bug or error, please add an issue here on GitHub. Feature requests are welcome. However, this is a community effort, so pull requests are preferred.

## Create a Pull Request

Fork the project, create a branch, commit your changes, and then create a pull request. Please submit your pull request to the **develop** branch of this repository.

The **master** branch is for production-ready code and should not contain incomplete features. Development occurs on the **develop** branch. Once your pull request is accepted, it will be merged into **master**.

## Tags

This repository uses tags to mark intermediate steps of the app development, and these tags correspond to lessons in the [Teaching App Development with Swift](http://swifteducation.github.io) course materials. For example, the tag **lesson01** represents an Xcode project that is ready for working through the steps in Lesson 1. The **end** tag always represents the completed app, which represents an Xcode project that has accomplished all of the features within all of the respective lesson plans for the project.

## Impacts to Lesson Plans
